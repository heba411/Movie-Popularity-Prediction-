# Introduction
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether they are a commercial success?
Using machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression, we can predict which films will be highly rated.

## Dataset Definition:
For our analysis, we got a dataset contains 3039 rows each row consists of 17 independent features and 1 dependent feature (vote_average).
